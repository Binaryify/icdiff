Options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --cols=COLS          specify the width of the screen. Autodetection is Linux
                       only
  --head=HEAD          consider only the first N lines of each file
  --highlight          color by changing the background color instead of the
                       foreground color.  Very fast, ugly, displays all
                       changes
  --line-numbers       generate output with line numbers
  --numlines=NUMLINES  how many lines of context to print; only meaningful

  --show-all-spaces    color all non-matching whitespace including that which
                       is not needed for drawing the eye to changes.  Slow,
                       ugly, displays all changes
  --version            print version and exit
  --whole-file         show the whole file instead of just changed lines and
                       context
