No installation program.  Simply make icdiff.py excecutable and put it

Run icdiff.py for the most up-to-date usage, but this is the cached
usage:


Usage: icdiff.py [options] left_file right_file

Show differences between files in a two column view.

Options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --cols=COLS          specify the width of the screen. Autodetection
                       is Linux only
  --context            print only differences with some context
  --numlines=NUMLINES  how many lines of context to print; only
                       meaningful with --context
  --line-numbers       generate output with line numbers
  --head=HEAD          consider only the first N lines of each file
  --highlight          color by changing the background color instead
                       of the foreground color.  Very fast, ugly, displays
                       all changes
  --show-all-spaces    color all non-matching whitespace including
                       that which is not needed for drawing the eye to
                       changes. Slow, ugly, displays all changes
  --print-headers      label the left and right sides with their file
                       names
